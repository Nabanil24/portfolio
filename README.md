# 📁 Data Engineering & Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Engineering & Analytics Portfolio, a curated collection of projects showcasing my skills in data warehousing, ETL pipeline development, data modeling, and analytics.
Each project is designed to reflect real-world industry practices—ranging from building modern data architectures to uncovering actionable insights through SQL and BI techniques.


Feel free to explore the projects, dive into the code, and check out the documentation included with each build.
I'm actively expanding this portfolio as I continue learning and building.
